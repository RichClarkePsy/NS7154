# Getting started

## Installing R and RStudio

**R** is a programming language that you’ll be learning to write code in, while **RStudio** is what is know as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working with R easier. I will largely use the terms "R" and "RStudio" interchangeable throughout this course, but you can think of writing in R as you would writing in English and RStudio the program you write it in. You *could* write all your written assignment in NotePad but Microsoft Word gives you a lot more freedom so that’s often the default. The same logic is true for R, using RStudio just makes life a lot easier.
<br/>

**To get started you will** ***first*** **need to install the language R and** ***then*** **the IDE of RStudio**. Both can be installed, for free, from the company that maintains them, [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). From there you will then need to select your operating system (Windows or Mac). 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Installing RStudio.png")
```

One of the best things about using R and RStudio is that they are both very widely used across many academic disciplines, and in the professional world. As such there are many guides for installation. If you hit on an issue with installation, it's very likely other have too. Here are some helpful links to help you install R and RStudio your own home computer (which I highly recommend you do):

## Opening RStudio for the first time

When you first open RStudio you should be greeted by a page that looks like this:


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/IDE screenshot1.png")
```

If not double check that it is RStudio that you are opening and not just R in a text editor. 

First thing I suggest you do is click **File** `->` **New File** `->` **R Script**. This will show you the normal view you will get when working in R. 
Here you have four segments to your screen:

1. The console (Bottom left) - For directly running short snippets of code, also where all your output and errors (sooo many errors) will be shown.
2. The script editor (Top left) - For writing longer chunks of code that you'll then be able to save out as a file.  
3. An area that shows you any functions and objects you create (Top right).
4. An area that shows you any of the fancy figures you create, also somewhere that you can navigate your files from (Bottom right).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/IDE screenshot2.png")
```

You’ll become intimately aware of what each of these areas do over the course of this module but if you want a overview of these sections now [this video]( https://posit.co/resources/videos/programming-part-1-writing-code-in-rstudio/) give a good introduction to each section (I recommend watching from around 5mins 45sec). 

Finally for the basic set up, it is very important to look cool while doing your analysis in R. To change the basic appearance: 

Click **Tools** `->` **Global Options** `->` **Appearance**. 

I like the Editor Theme *Vibrant Ink*. It makes me feel like I'm a hacker from the 90's. Also, if you're old like me you may want to make use of **View** `->` **Zoom in** option.   

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/IDE screenshot3.png")
```

Stressed yet? Don't worry, we'll have your screen looking like this in no time. There is a learning curve for R but once things start to click you'll love it! 

## Packages

The basic functions of R are great, but one of the most useful things about working in R (instead of the commercial software) is its ability to incorporate user generated content to customise what we're able to do. Such add-on content are known as **packages**. The validated and most frequently used packages are stored on the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) server and RStudio knows exactly where to find them, as long as you know the name of the package. So no need to click around random websites downloading files to install, which is nice. 

For this module we will make extensive use of the `tidyverse` package. This is a package that brings together a set of grammar and visulisation tools that makes the process of writing in R a whole lot easier.  
To install the `tidyverse` package type the following code into your console (next to the bottom >) and then hit enter key to run the code. Or you can copy and paste directly from this document by clicking the clipboard icon in the top right of the box. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

You only ever need to install a package once per computer but you will need to load it each time you open RStudio. In these subsequent times this is the only code you'll need:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Each analysis  that you write its a good idea to include the packages as the first code on the script, so copy out this code and place it at the top of your new script (top left of your screen, if you've created one).

To run this, and any code, you can either highlight the code and click the **Run** button in the top right of the script window. Or you can navagate to the line that you want to run and hit **Ctrl+Enter**.
